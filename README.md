# yart : Yet Another Raspberry Pi Telecine

First I have to thank Joe Herman for his project https://github.com/jphfilm/rpi-film-capture. My project is not a fork because all the software part has been rewritten. However, the concept and whole hardware part takes up Joe's ideas.

For now the project only includes this documentation file as proof of concept and implementation ideas. The source code will soon be released.

Documentation (in french ! Google translate is your best friend)
